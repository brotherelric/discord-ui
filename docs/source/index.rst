Welcome to the discord-ui docs!

This libary is an extension to `discord.py <https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py>`__  which helps you 
using ui and interaction features in discord.
With this libary, you can send message components like Buttons, LinkButtons and SelectMenus, 
receive data like who pressed the button and who selected which value in a menu, create 
application-commands like slash-commands, message-commands and user-commands, receive their interaction and 
the used options.
